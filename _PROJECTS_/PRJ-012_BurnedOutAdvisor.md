### Brand Separation

| Brand | Domain | Audience | Retreat | Status |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| **BurnedOutAdvisor.com** | ✅ Owned | Financial Advisors | **Summer 2026** (Colorado) | 🔴 **PRJ-012 — ACTIVE** |
| **BurnedOutCPA.com** | ⬜ TBD | CPAs / Accountants | **Nov 2026** | ⬜ FUTURE PROJECT |

> **BurnedOutCPA.com is NOT part of PRJ-012.** Same parent brand, different audience, different domain, different retreat, different project.

## 📋 Mission + Positioning

### Mission

> Help burned out financial advisors recover, reconnect, and reignite their careers through a premium retreat and ongoing coaching — led by someone who speaks their language.

### Positioning Statement

> BurnedOutAdvisor.com is the only recovery + growth program built specifically FOR burned out financial advisors. Not a generic burnout coach. Not a consultant from outside the industry. A peer who understands the daily reality of managing clients, compliance, and career pressure.

### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Their Angle | BurnedOutAdvisor.com Differentiation |
|-----------|------------|--------------------------------------|
| Generic burnout coaches | Broad audience, no industry expertise | **FA-specific** — speaks the language |
| Burnout Recovery Accelerator | Clinical NLP, psychedelic therapy, $60K+ | **Peer-led, industry-specific, $4,888** |
| Executive burnout retreats | General executive coaching | **Financial advisor niche, retreat + tech bundle** |
| ME Retreat Series | Entrepreneur focus | **FA-specific, Colorado setting, tech-enabled** |
| Industry conferences (T3, Barron's) | Education, not recovery | **Recovery + growth, not just content** |

> **Gap in market:** No one serves burned out financial advisors specifically with a retreat + technology + coaching bundle.

---

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Voice | @THY (mrsyonks) |
