## 📋 Executive Summary

Evening side event during ETHDenver 2026, strategically positioned immediately after the ETHVC Summit + Pitchfest. Targeting 20-30 attendees — VCs, founders, and builders who just spent 8 hours in VC pitch mode. ♾️ WeOwnNet 🌐 presents the cooperative alternative: "What if you didn't need a VC?" This is the only #RealEstate / #Cooperative / #RWA event at ETHDenver 2026 — a gap in the market that we own.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Why** | Zero #RWA/#Cooperative events at ETHDenver = we own this niche |
| **What** | Dinner / networking / presentation — cooperative ownership meets Web3 |
| **When** | Wed 18 Feb 2026, 6:00-9:00 PM MST |
| **Who** | 20-30 attendees (ETHVC crowd + builders + community) |
| **Where** | Denver, CO — RiNo District (recommended) |

## 📋 Strategic Context

### The Opportunity

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Timing** | Wed 18 Feb evening — ETHVC Summit attendees just finished 8 hours of VC/founder content |
| **Audience** | 232+ ETHVC attendees (VCs, founders, builders) — hungry, tired, looking for dinner |
| **Gap** | ❌ NO #RealEstate / #Cooperative / #RWA events at ETHDenver |
| **Positioning** | ♾️ WeOwnNet 🌐 + OCPA Group = **only cooperative real estate voice at ETHDenver** |
| **Narrative** | "From pitching VCs to owning together" — cooperative alternative to VC model |

### Why Wed 18 Feb Evening

| Factor | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| ETHVC Summit ends 6PM | Attendees are FREE |
| Day 2 of ETHDenver | People are settled, networking mode |
| NOT opening night (Tue) | Avoids kickoff party competition |
| NOT late week (Thu-Fri) | Before BUIDLathon fatigue sets in |
| After VC conversations | Perfect contrast — "what if you didn't need a VC?" |

### Narrative Arc

```
ETHVC Summit (10AM-6PM): "How to raise from VCs"
    │
    ▼ 6:00 PM — Walk to dinner
    │
#SideEvent (6PM-9PM): "What if you didn't need one?"
    │
    ▼
♾️ WeOwnNet 🌐: Cooperative ownership > VC dependency
```

## 📋 OCPA Group Positioning

### Why ETHDenver Matters for OCPA

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **No RWA events** | Gap in ETHDenver programming |
| **No cooperative events** | Zero competition for this niche |
| **VC fatigue** | After 8 hours of VC content, cooperative model = refreshing |
| **Builder audience** | Developers who could BUILD cooperative tools |
| **Investor audience** | VCs who could FUND cooperative infrastructure |

### OCPA Talking Points for Web3 Audience

| # | Point |
|---|-------|
| 1 | Real estate tokenization via cooperative structure |
| 2 | On-chain governance (cccbot.eth on snapshot.box) |
| 3 | Data sovereignty (Priority #3) — users own their data |
| 4 | #FedArch — multi-agent AI governance framework |
| 5 | FOSS (Priority #2) — open source everything |
